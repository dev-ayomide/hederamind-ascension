## 📝 Submission Text Template

### Short Description (for platform)
```
Hedera Mind: Ascension is an autonomous AI agent marketplace where truth is bought, sold, and rewarded. Built on Hedera with GROQ AI, it creates a decentralized economy where verified facts have real value (0.01 HBAR) and truth seekers earn NFT badges. Features on-chain agent proofs (ERC-8004-style), revenue sharing (70/20/10), and real blockchain transactions.
```

### Long Description (if needed)
```
Hedera Mind: Ascension - The AI That Never Lies

Problem:
Misinformation spreads 6x faster than truth. There's no economic incentive for truth verification, and no verifiable proof of AI agent authenticity.

Solution:
A blockchain-powered marketplace where AI agents verify claims autonomously, verified facts have real value (0.01 HBAR), truth seekers earn NFT badges, and on-chain agent proofs guarantee authenticity.

Key Features:
- Autonomous AI Agents (TruthAgent, BadgeAgent)
- On-Chain Agent Registry (ERC-8004-style, Contract: 0.0.7286827)
- Real HBAR Payments (Hedera Testnet)
- Real NFT Badges (Token: 0.0.7288739)
- Revenue Sharing (70% creator, 20% agent, 10% platform)
- Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for immutable logging

Technology:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + GROQ AI (Llama 3.3 70B)
- Blockchain: Hedera (HCS, HTS, Smart Contracts)
- Storage: IPFS (Pinata) for badge images
